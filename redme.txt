!!! 'main.py' is the script that converts pdf in multiple tables
!!!!! ALL user variables are saved in .env, you can change there the name, page range and the type value for type column
!!!!!!!!!!!!!For tabula you should install JAVA!!!!!!!!!

I added <<                          FIRST_CATEGORY_AUTO witch should ALWAYS be a bool (True or False). I use this because sometimes the pdf doesn`t have the info and you should add it manually.
        FIRST_CATEGORY_AUTO=False
        SECTION_NONAUTO="Organic"   SECTION_NONAUTO this value tells us what the program should use if the first section value doesn`t exist, This is relevant ONLY with FIRST_CATEGORY_AUTO=False
                               >>   this is only for
